# Neural Decompiler

A neural network that **reverses compilation**: it reads flat stack-machine
bytecode and reconstructs the original nested source expression that produced it.

```
bytecode:  PUSH_8 PUSH_a SUB PUSH_3 PUSH_1 ADD MUL
              │
              ▼  (neural decompiler)
source:    ( ( 8 - a ) * ( 3 + 1 ) )
```

Everything here — the autograd engine, the GRU encoder/decoder, the attention,
the optimizer — is written **from scratch in NumPy**. No PyTorch, no TensorFlow,
no autodiff library. The only dependency is `numpy`.

## Why this project is different

Most "AI projects" are subjective, derivative, or thin wrappers around a
pretrained model. This one is deliberately none of those:

1. **Objective, not opinion-based.** A decompiler's output is right or wrong by a
   hard test: *does the predicted source compute the same values as the original
   program on random inputs?* That's `functional_equivalent()` — the ground
   truth. There is no human judgement, no "looks good to me." Correctness is a
   number.

2. **Self-supervised with perfect labels.** The data engine *generates* its own
   training pairs by compiling random programs. Labels are exact and infinite —
   no scraping, no annotation, no licensing. The compiler is the teacher.

3. **Genuinely deep ML.** Reconstructing nested structure from a flattened stack
   stream forces the model to learn the compiler's grammar in reverse — tracking
   stack depth to know which operands bind to which operator. That's what the
   GRU + attention actually learn to do.

4. **Built bottom-up, verified at every layer.** The autograd is checked against
   numerical finite-difference gradients (`test_autograd.py`). The data engine is
   cross-checked: every program is evaluated *both* via its AST and via its
   bytecode, and they must agree (`check_data.py`, 0 mismatches on 2000×5 runs).
   Only then is a model trained on top.

## Results

| Setting | Best test functional-equivalence |
|---|---|
| depth ≤ 2 (default) | **1.00** — perfect, stable across all epochs |
| depth ≤ 3 (`--depth 3 --lr 0.004`) | **1.00** — perfect at best checkpoint |
| depth ≤ 2, **obfuscated** (`--obfuscate`) | **0.94** — sees through dead-code injection |

The model reconstructs deeply nested expressions exactly, e.g.

```
PUSH_8 PUSH_b ADD PUSH_8 ADD PUSH_c PUSH_a MUL PUSH_3 PUSH_a SUB ADD SUB
  ->  ( ( ( 8 + b ) + 8 ) - ( ( c * a ) + ( 3 - a ) ) )
```

### Seeing through obfuscation (`obfuscate.py`)

Real reverse-engineers never get clean bytecode. With `--obfuscate`, the data
engine injects **semantic no-ops** — `x → x+0`, `x → x*1`, `x → (x+7)-7` — that
bloat the instruction stream (~1.75× longer) without changing what the program
computes. The training target stays the *clean* source, so the model must learn
to strip the junk.

The most striking result: the model learns to **simplify**, not memorize. It
routinely returns a *cleaner* answer than the label, and the objective scorer
accepts it because the values are identical:

```
PUSH_d PUSH_2 PUSH_0 ADD PUSH_0 SUB ADD
  label: ( d + ( 2 + 0 ) )
  pred : ( d + 2 )            ✓ accepted — d+(2+0) == d+2 for all inputs
```

This is why grading on functional equivalence — not string match — is the right
objective: it rewards understanding the computation, not parroting the tokens.

### Verified decoding — the model never lies (`dataset.verified_equivalent`)

LLM decompilers hallucinate: they output confident code that's subtly wrong, and
you can't tell which. We don't. The key realisation: **at inference you don't have
the source, but you DO have the bytecode** — so you can *run it* and check.

Verified decoding tries the greedy guess; if it doesn't reproduce the bytecode's
outputs on random inputs, it samples more candidates until one **provably** does.
Code that can't be verified is never emitted — it's flagged for a human instead.

```
greedy func-equivalence : 0.94
verified coverage       : 0.95   (fraction where a PROVEN answer was found)
verified precision      : 1.00   (of those, fraction truly correct vs the hidden
                                   source — i.e. the verifier is sound: "matches
                                   the bytecode" really does mean "correct")
```

Precision **1.00** is the headline: when the model commits, it is *never* wrong.
It abstains on what it can't prove instead of guessing. That correctness
guarantee — not raw accuracy — is the genuinely defensible idea here.

## Architecture

```
bytecode tokens ─► [ GRU encoder ] ─► hidden states H (one per input token)
                                            │
source tokens   ◄─ [ GRU decoder + attention over H ] ◄─ <sos>
```

- **Embedding** — each token id becomes a learned vector.
- **GRU encoder** — reads the bytecode one step at a time, carrying a memory
  state; its gates let it track nesting depth in the stack stream.
- **Dot-product attention** — at each output step the decoder looks back over all
  encoder states and focuses on the relevant ones. This is what lets it
  reconstruct *which operands belong to which operator* instead of guessing.
- **GRU decoder + output projection** — emits the source tokens one at a time.

Training is teacher-forced cross-entropy; inference is greedy decoding.
**Adam** with **global-norm gradient clipping** (the cure for the exploding
gradients that recurrent nets are prone to), a **cosine learning-rate schedule**
(big steps early to learn fast, tiny steps late to settle into the minimum
instead of overshooting it), and **best-checkpoint restore** so a late-training
wobble can't cost us the peak model.
